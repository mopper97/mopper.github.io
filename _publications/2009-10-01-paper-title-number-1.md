We look at whether Elman's idea of curriculum learning can be revitalised using developmentally plausible data. While we found no benefit over random sampling using the BabyLM pre-training corpora, we were able to attribute this to the majority of the data being high utility (i.e., simple transcribed speech). When we switched to a training setting where a lot of the data was more complicated and lowered the proportion of transcribed speech, we found some preliminary evidence that it might be worth starting small after all.
