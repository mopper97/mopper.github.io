Hi there stranger, welcome to my page!

I'm a PhD student in machine learning at the University of Edinburgh's [ILCC](https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/ilcc), supervised by [Siddharth Narayanaswamy](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/snaraya3/) and [Ivan Titov](http://ivan-titov.org/).

My work is largely about looking at inductive biases that can make ML models more efficient and explainable. If you are interested in my research, you can find a list of my publications on [here](https://mopper97.github.io/publications/). At the moment my work centres on NLP, but I am looking to expand the framework to CV and multi-modal applications in the future!

For undergrad I studied Philosophy at UCL, which got me interested in trying to mathematicize language and cognition more generally. I also started teaching myself coding and ML on the side. Which meant that afterward I could move to Edinburgh to take the MSc in Speech and Language Processing, and from there start my PhD. 
 
Outside of academia I also work in industry part-time
